title: Course Overview
description: An overview of the main topics and objectives of the Artificial Intelligence course for teachers at the Greppi Institute in Monticello Brianza.
---

## Quick introduction üëã

This introductory course aims to provide teachers with the knowledge and practical skills to use AI not only as a personal productivity tool, but as a true ally for designing more inclusive, personalized, and engaging learning experiences for students. Through a practical and hands-on approach, we will explore the potential, mechanisms, and ethical implications of this technology, empowering educators to lead innovation in schools.

---

## Course objectives

By the end of the program, teachers will be able to:

- Understand how generative AI and large language models (LLMs) work at a high level.
- Apply prompt engineering techniques to communicate effectively with AI and get targeted results.
- Design learning units, activities, and projects (e.g., Project Based Learning) with AI support.
- Create and use personalized assistants for specific teaching needs.
- Generate multimedia teaching materials (maps, presentations, images, podcasts) using specialized AI tools.
- Promote a critical, responsible, and ethical use of AI among students, recognizing opportunities and risks.

---

## Methodology

The course adopts a theory-to-practice approach. Each lesson is divided into two phases:

1. Presentation phase: introduction to key concepts, tools, and operational strategies.
2. Hands-on phase: teachers will work directly with AI platforms, practicing what they learned through guided exercises and collaborative activities.

## Detailed course outline

### Core module

#### Lesson 1: What is generative AI and how does it work?

- Main topics:
  - introduction to generative AI.
  - essential components: large language models (LLM)
  - high-level understanding of Transformers
  - the concept of tokens
  - the probabilistic nature of AI
  - overview and comparison of the main platforms: Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and others.

#### Lesson 2: Prompt Engineering principles for teaching

- Main topics:
  - what is Prompt Engineering
  - anatomy of an effective prompt: role, context, task, output format.
  - basic and advanced techniques (e.g., few-shot, chain-of-thought)
  - prompt examples for lesson plans, exercises, and rubrics.

#### Lesson 3: Advanced prompting and instructional design

- Main topics:
  - using AI as a partner in design (e.g., Project Based Learning, debate, role-playing).
  - creating and using personalized assistants (GPTs, Gems)
  - critical analysis of results: recognizing and managing errors, bias, and AI hallucinations.

#### Lesson 4: "AI that processes your content": NotebookLM and beyond

- Main topics:
  - introduction to source-grounded platforms like NotebookLM
  - core features: summarize, query documents, generate study guides, concept maps, FAQs, and glossaries from your own sources (PDFs, slides, transcripts)
  - creating chatbots that answer based on a predefined knowledge base.

#### Lesson 5: AI for creativity and inclusion

- Main topics:
  - overview of specialized tools for visual content: concept maps (e.g., Napkin, Chatmind, NotebookLM), presentations (e.g., Gamma, Canva), images (Nano-Banana, DALL-E 3, etc.) and videos (Veo 3, Sora, etc.)
  - focus on using AI as a compensatory tool and support for students with special educational needs.

#### Lesson 6: Responsible use, ethics, and safety of AI

- Main topics:
  - the plagiarism dilemma: tools to detect AI-generated content and strategies to design "AI-proof" assignments
  - the most used apps by students
  - risks, bias, and ethical implications
  - EU regulation (AI Act) and school policies.

### Optional deep-dive lessons

#### Lesson 7 (Optional - Humanities): How machines became smart without thinking like humans

- Main topics:
  - an overview of the impact of intelligent algorithms on people‚Äôs lives
  - the ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù to build intelligent machines that don‚Äôt think deductively
  - social machines and recommendation systems: assistants or controllers?
  - "Attention Is All You Need": the algorithm that unveiled the secret of knowledge.
  - emergent properties in LLMs when their size exceeds a critical threshold
  - beyond the limits of our knowledge: how will we manage machines smarter than us?

#### Lesson 8 (Optional - STEM): "Vibe Coding" for the classroom

- Main topics:
  - using AI to generate working code without knowing how to program
  - exporting and sharing LLM outputs
  - building interactive simulations (e.g., mass-spring system, pendulum, molecules)
  - dynamic charts from data (e.g., spreadsheets)
  - interactive quizzes and simple educational games.
